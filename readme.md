# üö™better-escape.nvim

This plugin is the lua version of [better_escape.vim](https://github.com/jdhao/better-escape.vim),
with some additional features and optimizations

A lot of people have mappings like `jk` or `jj` to escape insert mode.
The problem with this mappings is that whenever you type a `j`, neovim waits about 100-500ms (depending on your timeoutlen) to see, if you type a `j` or a `k` because these are mapped.
Only after that time the `j` will be inserted.
Then you always get a delay when typing a `j`.

This looks like this (see below for a gif):

## ‚ú®Features

- Escape without getting delay when typing in insert mode
- Customizable mapping and timeout
- Use multiple mappings
- Really small and fast

## üì¶Installation

Use your favourite package manager and call the setup function.

```lua
-- lua with packer.nvim
use {
  "max397574/better-escape.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("better_escape").setup()
  end,
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏èCustomization

Call the setup function with your options as arguments.

```lua
-- lua, default settings
require("better_escape").setup {
    -- the time in which the keys must be hit in ms. Use option timeoutlen by default
    timeout = vim.o.timeoutlen,
    mappings = {
        i = {
            j = {
                k = "<Esc>",
                j = "<Esc>",
            },
        },
        c = {
            j = {
                k = "<Esc>",
                j = "<Esc>",
            },
        },
    },
}
```
